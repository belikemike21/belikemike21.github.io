I'm a Software Engiener at **Cerner Corporation**, a healthcare and information technology company.

Before that, I was formerly a software engineer intern at an AI startup **Kip** in NYC. Before that, I was formerly a software engineer at **Accenture Services** in India (not to be confused with Accenture consultancy).


In 2016, I came to US to pursue my Masters degree in Computer Science and from that point being, I relentlessly acquired new skills and improved myself as a person and as a software engineer.


In 2019, I quit drinking soft drinks, tea and coffee. Now, I drink only water.


I walk 5 miles a day. Walking became a part of my lifestyle now.   
I watch comedy series most of the time and learn something new daily.  


My area of interest lies in Big Data and Automation.
